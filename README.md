# MyNBA | Final Project

Our objective for this project is to create a website that allows users to sign up and log in to an NBA page. 
Once logged in, they can view the scores of their favorite teams, the in-game odds, and the best bets provided in real time.
The API we will be utilizing is free, but it may not provide accurate scores since one needs to pay to obtain the actual scores.

* User login: A simple login and signup page that allows users to sign up and log in to our page.
* Beautification: We tried making each page as appealing as possible while trying to make each page user-friendly.
* React frontend: Use React frontend for the scores page, in-game odds, and best bets.

## Things we enjoyed and learned from this project
* We were able to properly use the git branch commands along with understanding how to use git pull properly
* We enjoyed making the website as aesthetically pleasing pleasing as possible.
* Learning the folder heirarchy for React and how to integrate it with non-React pages was difficult but interesting

## Things we didn't enjoy and would like learned from this project
* The sportsdata.io api that we used was in free trial mode, meaning that certain data was scrambled, like the scores and money line.
* In addition to the scrambled values, the api also would not allow us to view the Best Bets information in trial mode.
