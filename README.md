# MyNBA | Final Project

Our objective for this project is to create a website that allows users to sign up and log in to an NBA page. 
Once logged in, they can view the scores of their favorite teams, the in-game odds, and the best bets provided in real time.
The API we will be utilizing is free, but it may not provide accurate scores since one needs to pay to obtain the actual scores.

* Beautification: We tried making each page as appealing as possible while trying to make each page user-friendly.

### Things we enjoyed and learned from this project
* We were able to properly use the git branch commands along with understanding how to use git pull properly
* We enjoyed making the website as aesthetically pleasing pleasing as possible.

### Things we didn't enjoy and would like learned from this project
* We had an awful time trying to deploy our web to fly.io and maybe still be experiencing issues after the submission.
* We would both love to learn React to properly use it and be able to use it to its fullest potential.
