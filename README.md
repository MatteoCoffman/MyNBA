# MyNBA | Final Project

Our objective for this project is to create a website that allows users to sign up and log in to an NBA page. 
Once logged in, they can view the scores of their favorite teams, the in-game odds, and the best bets provided in real time.
The API we will be utilizing is free, but it may not provide accurate scores since one needs to pay to obtain the actual scores.
